## About me:
Hi friend, as you've already read at the beginning of my CV, my name is Vlad. I enjoy programming, and I also like teaching others. I teach Python development to children at an online programming school. I'm also interested in 3D modeling, and in the future, I would like to develop in that direction as well. Thank you for paying attention to my CV, and good luck to you going forward!
